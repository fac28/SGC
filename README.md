### :wave: Welcome to the repo for SGC retrospectives

Please upload your team and cohort SGCs in a folder corresponding to the current week :calendar:

If your SGC was made using HackMD, you can copy and paste the markdown straight into the new file. If done on a whiteboard please upload a picture.

If there is no folder for your current week, you are have honour of making it! :tada: 

### How do I make a new folder?
