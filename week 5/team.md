## Issy - Tommaso: 
  - **Stop**:
      - Creating files before being used(cause sometimes we don t really need them)
  - **Go**:
      - Write tests
      - Go micro before going macro
      - Refactor before things get too big
  - **Continue**:
      - Communicating when we get stuck
      - Splitting work
      - Stepping back from problems
