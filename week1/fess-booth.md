## STOP
- Scope Creep: changing project targets mid development
- Big Changes: Don't make huge changes and push them up without warning

## GO
- More time on project spike/reading accpetence criteria
- Discplined pairing
- Your pair partner also acting as an accountablility buddy to stop you from scope creek
- Mini code review to get group upto speed when you have clever/unclear chnanges
- Prioritised/Organized workflow. Basically, only move to another feature when the first one have been finished
- Having a checklist when starting project: style guide, eslint...

## CONTINUE
- Pairing
- Git flow (feature branch => dev branch => main branch)
- Sepcific roles
- Delegating task to someone when stuck
- Emojis. Because why not?
